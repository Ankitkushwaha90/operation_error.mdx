### Operators and Expressions in Java
# Operators and Expressions

Operators in Java are symbols that perform operations on operands. Expressions are combinations of operators and operands that produce a result. In this module, we'll cover arithmetic, relational, logical, conditional (ternary), and bitwise operators in Java.


## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric operands. The basic arithmetic operators in Java are:

- **Addition (`+`):** Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (`-`):** Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (`*`):** Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (`/`):** Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (`%`):** Returns the remainder of the division.

Example:

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

int sum = a + b; // 15
int difference = a - b; // 5
int product = a * b; // 50
int quotient = a / b; // 2
int remainder = a % b; // 0
```
### Relational Operators
Relational operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean result (true or false) based on the comparison. The relational operators in Java are:

- Equal to (==)
- Not equal to (!=)
- Greater than (>)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than (<)
- Less than or equal to (<=)
Example:

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 5;

boolean isEqual = (x == y); // false
boolean isNotEqual = (x != y); // true
boolean isGreater = (x > y); // true
boolean isLessOrEqual = (x <= y); // false
```
### Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean operands. The logical operators in Java are:

- Logical AND (&&)
- Logical OR (||)
- Logical NOT (!)
Example:

```java
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;

boolean result1 = (a && b); // false
boolean result2 = (a || b); // true
boolean result3 = !a; // false
```
### Conditional (Ternary) Operator
The conditional operator (also known as the ternary operator) is a shorthand way of writing if-else statements. It has the following syntax:

```java
condition ? expression1 : expression2
```
If the condition is true, expression1 is evaluated; otherwise, expression2 is evaluated.

Example:

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 5;

int max = (x > y) ? x : y; // max is assigned the value of x (10)
```
### Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integer operands. They operate on individual bits of the operands. The bitwise operators in Java are:

- Bitwise AND (&)
- Bitwise OR (|)
- Bitwise XOR (^)
- Bitwise NOT (~)
- Left Shift (<<)
- Right Shift (>>)
- Unsigned Right Shift (>>>)
Example:

```java
int a = 5; // 101
int b = 3; // 011

int bitwiseAnd = a & b; // 001 (1)
int bitwiseOr = a | b; // 111 (7)
int bitwiseXor = a ^ b; // 110 (6)
int bitwiseComplement = ~a; // 11111111111111111111111111111010 (-6)
int leftShift = a << 1; // 1010 (10)
int rightShift = a >> 1; // 10 (2)
int unsignedRightShift = a >>> 1; // 10 (2)
```
That's it for this module on operators and expressions in Java! In the next module, we'll explore control flow statements.
